# Creating an Android Project

If you don't have a project opened, in the **Welcome** screen, click **New Project**.

If you have a project opened, from the **File** menu, select **New Project**. The *Create New Project* screen appears

**Application Name** is the app name that appears to users.

**Company domain** provides a qualifier that will be appended to the package name; Android Studio will remember this qualifier for each new project you create.

**Package name** is the fully qualified name for the project (following the same rules as those for naming packages in the Java programming language). Your package name must be unique across all packages installed on the Android system. You can **Edit** this value independently from the application name or the company domain.

**Project location** is the directory on your system that holds the project files.
